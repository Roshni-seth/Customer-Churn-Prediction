# Customer Churn Prediction

## üìå Project Overview
This project aims to predict customer churn using machine learning models. We performed feature engineering, explored the dataset, and trained multiple models to identify customers likely to leave.

## üìÇ Dataset
The dataset consists of customer details, including demographic, account-related, and financial information. The target variable is **Exited** (1 = Churned, 0 = Retained).

## ‚öôÔ∏è Feature Engineering
- **Dropped Unnecessary Columns:** Removed `RowNumber`, `CustomerId`, and `Surname` as they don‚Äôt contribute to prediction.
- **Checked Missing Values:** No missing values were found in the dataset.
- **Encoded Categorical Variables:** Converted `Gender` and `Geography` using label encoding and one-hot encoding.
- **Feature Importance Analysis:** Identified key features contributing to churn using Random Forest.

## üìä Models Implemented
We trained multiple machine learning models and evaluated their performance:

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Logistic Regression
- **Accuracy:** 82%
- **Classification Report:** Precision, Recall, and F1-score included.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Decision Tree
- **Accuracy:** 84%
- **Classification Report:** Precision, Recall, and F1-score included.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Random Forest
- **Accuracy:** 87%
- **Classification Report:** Precision, Recall, and F1-score included.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ XGBoost
- **Accuracy:** 86%
- **Classification Report:** Precision, Recall, and F1-score included.

## üîë Key Insights
- **Age** and **Number of Products** were the most significant factors influencing churn.
- Customers from **Germany** had a higher likelihood of churning.
- **Active members** were less likely to leave.
- **XGBoost and Random Forest** provided the highest accuracy.

## üöÄ Next Steps
- **Hyperparameter tuning** to improve model performance.
- **Handling class imbalance** using SMOTE or weighted models.
- **Explainable AI (SHAP)** to interpret individual predictions.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
- **Python** (pandas, numpy, sklearn, xgboost, matplotlib, seaborn)
- **Jupyter Notebook** for experimentation
